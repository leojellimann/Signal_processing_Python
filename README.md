# Signal_processing_Python
These are the three projects I coded in Python, for my Signal Processing class, during my second year of Computer Science Enigineering School in 2021

These projects had been coded in Python using Jupyter Notebook for the first one and Spider for the two last.

Explanation of each code are given in each file (in French)

Feel free to execute the codes in your own environement :)
